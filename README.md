🩸 Blood Bank Management SystemProject OverviewThe Blood Bank Management System is a desktop application developed in Python using the tkinter library for the Graphical User Interface (GUI), matplotlib for real-time visualization of blood inventory, and MySQL for robust data management.This system facilitates core blood bank operations, including:Donor registration and donation tracking.Real-time inventory management for all blood groups.Patient blood request submission and fulfillment.Comprehensive viewing of donor and request records.✨ FeaturesDonor Management: Register new donors, automatically record their donation, and update their donation history.Real-time Inventory: A graphical bar chart (using Matplotlib) displays the current stock levels for all blood groups (A+, A-, B+, B-, O+, O-, AB+, AB-).Blood Request Handling: Patients can submit requests for specific blood groups and units.Request Fulfillment: Logic to check inventory and fulfill pending requests, automatically reducing stock upon completion.Data Persistence: Uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve all donor, patient, donation, and inventory data.User-Friendly Interface: A tabbed GUI (using ttk.Notebook) provides clear separation for different functions.🛠️ PrerequisitesBefore running the application, you must have the following installed:Python 3.xMySQL Server: Running on your system (e.g., via XAMPP, MySQL Workbench, etc.).📦 Installation and Setup1. Install Python DependenciesOpen your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the required Python libraries:Bashpip install tkinter matplotlib mysql-connector-python
2. Configure MySQL DatabaseYou need to update the database credentials in the main() function of the Python script.Locate the following section in the code and replace the placeholder values with your actual MySQL credentials:Pythondef main():
    # === UPDATE THESE to match your MySQL credentials ===
    DB_HOST = 'localhost'
    DB_USER = 'root'
    DB_PASSWORD = ''        # <-- put your DB password here
    DB_NAME = 'blood_bank_db'
    # ===================================================
    # ... rest of the main function
Note: The application is designed to automatically create the database (blood_bank_db) and all necessary tables (blood_inventory, donors, donations, patients, blood_requests) upon the first successful run.3. Run the ApplicationExecute the Python script:Bashpython blood_bank_app.py
🖥️ Application UsageThe application opens with a four-tab interface:1. Donor ManagementEnter the Name, Blood Group, Age (must be between 18 and 65 for a donation), and Contact of the donor.Click Add Donor. This action registers the donor, records a donation, increments their donation count, and updates the main Blood Inventory.2. Blood InventoryThis tab displays the current Units Available for all eight standard blood groups in a dynamic bar chart.Click Refresh Chart to update the visualization with the latest data.3. Blood RequestsSubmit a Request: Enter Patient Name, Blood Group Needed, Patient Age, Contact, and Units Needed. Click Submit Blood Request.Fulfill Requests: The lower half of the tab lists all uncompleted requests.Select a request from the list.Click Fulfill Selected Request. The system will check the inventory. If stock is sufficient, the request status is set to 'Completed', and the inventory is reduced. An error message appears if stock is insufficient.4. View All DonorsDisplays a comprehensive list of all registered donors, including their total Donation Count and the Last Donation date.Click Refresh Donor List to load the most current data.📚 Database SchemaThe application uses the following MySQL tables:Table NameDescriptionKey Fieldsblood_inventoryTracks current stock levels.blood_group (Primary Key), quantitydonorsStores donor personal and history data.donor_id (Primary Key), last_donation_date, donation_countdonationsRecords individual donation events.donation_id (Primary Key), donor_id (Foreign Key)patientsStores patient details for requests.patient_id (Primary Key)blood_requestsStores submitted blood requests.request_id (Primary Key), patient_id (Foreign Key), units_needed, status💡 Future EnhancementsLogin/User Authentication system.Advanced reporting features (e.g., monthly donations, low stock alerts).Search and filter functionality for Donor and Request lists.Integration of a proper logging system for transactions.
